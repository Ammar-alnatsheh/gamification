## Submitting changes
(I borrowed this from [opengov](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengovernment/opengovernment/master/CONTRIBUTING.md))
Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to gamification](https://github.com/learningOSSContributions/gamification/compare)

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for our purposes.

To contribute:  
1. Make your own fork of this [repo](https://github.com/learningOSSContributions/gamification/fork)  
2. Clone your repo to your local machine.
3. In your local clone, add one line to the file "updatable". You pick what to put in it. Save your change.  
4. Stage your file for committing
5. Commit your staged file's change with a message like "adding my line"
6. Use Torch!
7. Push your change from your local to your remote repo on github.
8. Submit a Pull Request from your fork to larningOSSContributions/gamification(there will be a button on github to make this happen)
9. A member of the learningOSSContributions team will accept your pull request
10. The hash of your PR will show up in the gamification repo's commits, which will help Torch identify your PR as your contribution.
